# Octave based calculator for Discord

This bot intends to allow users to interface with a MATLAB-like language through Discord using Octave which is an open source language very similar to MATLAB.

In its current state, this bot is very basic. I intend to make this more feature rich in the future.

Requirements:
- Have Octave installed on the bot device
